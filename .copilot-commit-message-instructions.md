# Commit Message Instructions

- Use conventional commit message format.
- The commit message should have a short description (50 characters or less) followed by a blank line and then a longer description.
- The short description should be in the format: `<type>(<scope>): <short description>`
  - `type`: The type of change (e.g., feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore).
    - `feat`: ✨ A new feature
    - `fix`: 🐛 A bug fix
    - `docs`: 📝 Documentation only changes
    - `style`: 💄 Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
    - `refactor`: ♻️ A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
    - `test`: ✅ Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
    - `chore`: 🔧 Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
  - `scope`: The scope of the change (e.g., component or file name). Include this if the change is specific to a particular part of the codebase.
  - `short description`: A brief summary of the change.
- The long description should provide additional context and details about the change.
- Reference any related issues or pull requests at the end of the long description.
