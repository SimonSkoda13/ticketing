# Commit Message Instructions

- Use conventional commit message format.
- The commit message should have a short description (50 characters or less) followed by a blank line and then a longer description.
- The short description should be in the format: `<type>(<scope>): <short description>`
  - `type`: The type of change (e.g., feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore).
  - `scope`: The scope of the change (e.g., component or file name).
  - `short description`: A brief summary of the change.
- The long description should provide additional context and details about the change.
- Reference any related issues or pull requests at the end of the long description.
